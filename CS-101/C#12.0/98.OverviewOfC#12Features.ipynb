    "> #### Overview of C#12.0 features \n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">C# 12.0 includes several new features that improve productivity and performance. Here are some of the new features:  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Primary constructors**: Primary constructors are a new feature in C# 12.0 that simplify the process of creating and initializing objects in C#. You can now create primary constructors in any class and struct. Primary constructor parameters are in scope for the entire body of the class. To ensure that all primary constructor parameters are definitely assigned, all explicitly declared constructors must call the primary constructor using this() syntax. Adding a primary constructor to a class prevents the compiler from declaring an implicit parameterless constructor. In a struct, the implicit parameterless constructor initializes all fields, including primary constructor parameters to the 0-bit pattern.   \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here is an example of how to use primary constructors in C# 12.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "    public class Person(string firstName, string lastName)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        public string FullName { get; } = $\"{firstName} {lastName}\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "> 2. **Collection expressions**: Collection expressions introduce a new terse syntax to create common collection values. Inlining other collections into these values is possible using a spread operator. Several collection-like types can be created without requiring external BCL support. These types are: array types, such as int[], System.Span<T> and System.ReadOnlySpan<T>, and types that support collection initializers, such as System.Collections.Generic.List<T>.  \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   Here is an example of how to use collection expressions in C# 12.0:\n",
    ">\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "    // Create an array:\n",
    "    int[] a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Create a list:\n",
    "    List<string> b = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"];\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Create a span:\n",
    "    Span<char> c = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'h', 'i'];\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Create a jagged 2D array:\n",
    "    int[][] twoD = [\n",
    "        [1, 2, 3],\n",
    "        [4, 5, 6],\n",
    "        [7, 8, 9]\n",
    "    ];\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Create a jagged 2D array from variables:\n",
    "    int[] row0 = [1, 2, 3];\n",
    "    int[] row1 = [4, 5, 6];\n",
    "    int[] row2 = [7, 8, 9];\n",
    "    int[][] twoDFromVariables = [row0, row1, row2];\n",
    "```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **Inline arrays**: Inline arrays are a new feature in C# 12.0 that allow you to create arrays with a concise syntax. You can use the [] operator to create an array with a specified length and initialize its elements in a single expression.  \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Here is an example of how to use inline arrays in C# 12.0:\n",
    ">\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "    int[] a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Optional parameters** in lambda expressions: Optional parameters in lambda expressions are a new feature in C# 12.0 that allow you to define default values for parameters on lambda expressions. This feature simplifies the syntax for defining lambda expressions with optional parameters.\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use optional parameters in lambda expressions in C# 12.0:\n",
    ">\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "    Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y = 0) => x + y;\n",
    "```\n",
    "> 5. **ref readonly parameters**: ref readonly parameters are a new feature in C# 12.0 that allow you to pass a reference to a value type without allowing the method to modify the value. This feature improves performance by avoiding unnecessary copying of large value types.\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use ref readonly parameters in C# 12.0:\n",
    ">\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "public void MyMethod(ref readonly int value)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  6. **Alias any type**: Alias any type is a new feature in C# 12.0 that allows you to create an alias for any type, including built-in types, user-defined types, and generic types.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here is an example of how to use alias any type in C# 12.0:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "    using Point = (int x, int y);\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void MyMethod(Point point)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // ...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```"
