    "> The Flyweight pattern, a structural design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects. Here’s a comprehensive overview:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. **What is the Flyweight Pattern**?\n",
    ">    -  The **Flyweight pattern** focuses on efficiently sharing a large number of objects by separating their *intrinsic state* (which is shared) from their *extrinsic state* (which is external and context-dependent).\n",
    ">    -  In simpler terms, it allows us to represent a large number of fine-grained objects using a smaller set of shared objects.\n",
    ">    -  This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects that have repetitive elements and would otherwise consume excessive memory if stored individually.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Problems Solved by the Flyweight Pattern**:\n",
    ">    -  *Memory Efficiency*: By sharing common data, the Flyweight pattern reduces memory usage significantly.\n",
    ">    -  *Performance Optimization*: It improves performance by minimizing object creation and storage overhead.\n",
    ">    -  *Scalability*: When dealing with a large number of similar objects, the Flyweight pattern ensures scalability without consuming excessive resources.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **Advantages of the Flyweight Pattern**:\n",
    ">    -  *Memory Savings*: Objects share common data, reducing memory footprint.\n",
    ">    -  *Performance Improvement*: Fewer objects lead to faster execution.\n",
    ">    -  *Scalability*: Easily handle large numbers of objects.\n",
    ">    -  *Flexibility*: Separation of intrinsic and extrinsic state allows for flexibility in object creation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Disadvantages of the Flyweight Pattern**:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">    -  *Complexity*: Implementing the pattern can be intricate, especially when managing shared state.\n",
    ">    -  *Increased Complexity for Clients*: Clients need to manage both intrinsic and extrinsic state.\n",
    ">    -  *Not Suitable for All Scenarios*: It’s most effective for fine-grained objects with shared data.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 5. **Structure of the Flyweight Pattern**:   \n",
    ">  The Flyweight pattern consists of the following components:  \n",
    ">    -  *Flyweight*: Represents the shared objects and defines methods for handling extrinsic state.  \n",
    ">    -  *ConcreteFlyweight*: Implements the Flyweight interface and stores intrinsic state.  \n",
    ">    -  *FlyweightFactory*: Creates and manages Flyweight objects, ensuring sharing and reusability.  \n",
    ">    -  *Client*: Utilizes Flyweight objects by passing in extrinsic state.  \n"
