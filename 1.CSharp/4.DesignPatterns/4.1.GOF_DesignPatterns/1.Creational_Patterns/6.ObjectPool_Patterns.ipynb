    "> The **Object Pool Pattern** is used to manage a set of initialized objects (a “pool”) that are kept ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  - Instead of creating and destroying objects on demand, the pool maintains a reusable collection of objects.\n",
    ">  - Clients can request objects from the pool, perform operations, and then return them when done.\n",
    ">  - This pattern is particularly useful when object instantiation is expensive and objects are needed for short periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    ">   - Creating instances of a class is computationally expensive.\n",
    ">   - Objects are needed frequently but only for short durations.\n",
    ">   - Instantiating and destroying objects repeatedly impacts performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In such cases, an object pool can help mitigate these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Benefits**\n",
    "> 1. **Performance Boost**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - Reusing existing objects from the pool avoids the overhead of creating new ones.\n",
    ">   - Each reuse saves time compared to creating fresh instances.\n",
    "> 2. **Resource Management**:\n",
    "\n",
    ">   - Object pools manage limited resources efficiently.\n",
    ">   - Useful for scenarios like database connections or thread management.\n",
    "> 3. **Drawbacks**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    1. Complexity:\n",
    ">      -  Object pools introduce additional complexity.\n",
    ">      -  Managing object lifetimes requires careful implementation.\n",
    ">    2. Reference Validity:\n",
    ">      -  Once an object is returned to the pool, existing references become invalid.\n",
    ">      -  Clients must be aware of this behavior.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Structure**\n",
    ">   - The Object Pool Pattern involves the following components:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   1. **Object Pool Interface**:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">    -  Declares methods for acquiring and releasing objects.\n",
    ">    -  Defines the pool behavior.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   2. Concrete Object Pool:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    -  Implements the object pool interface.\n",
    ">    -  Manages the pool of objects.\n",
    ">    -  Creates new objects if needed.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   3. Reusable Objects:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    -  The actual objects stored in the pool.\n",
    ">    -  These objects are reused by clients.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  - Example: Database connection pooling."
