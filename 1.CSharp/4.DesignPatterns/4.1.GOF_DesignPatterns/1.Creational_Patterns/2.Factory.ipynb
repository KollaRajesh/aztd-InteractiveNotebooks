    "> The **Factory Method Design Pattern** addresses the problem of creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n",
    ">   - It allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.\n",
    ">   - This pattern promotes code reuse, loose coupling, and encapsulates object creation logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Let’s dive into a detailed code example in C#:\n",

    "> **Problem**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   Imagine an application that needs to create different types of credit cards (e.g., MoneyBack, Tit anium, Platinum).  \n",
    ">   We want to create these credit card objects without knowing their exact implementation classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Solution (Factory Method)**:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Define an abstract class or interface (the Creator) with a method (the Factory Method) that returns a product (the Product).     \n",
    "> Subclasses (the Concrete Creators) override the Factory Method to create specific product instances (the Concrete Products).  \n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Loose Coupling**: The client code doesn’t depend on concrete credit card classes.   \n",
    "> **Code Reuse**: Different factories can create various credit card types.   \n",
    "> **Encapsulation**: Object creation logic is encapsulated in the Factory Method.  \n",
