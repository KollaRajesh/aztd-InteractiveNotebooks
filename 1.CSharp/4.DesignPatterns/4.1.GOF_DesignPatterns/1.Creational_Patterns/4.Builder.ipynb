    "> The **Builder Design Pattern** is a powerful technique used in object-oriented programming to address various object creation challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    " > Let’s explore its key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Purpose**:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   - The Builder pattern provides a flexible solution for creating complex objects.\n",
    ">   - It aims to separate the construction process of an object from its representation.\n",
    ">   - By doing so, the same construction process can create different representations of the same complex object.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why Use It**?:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - Consider scenarios where:\n",
    ">       - You need to create an object with many optional and required fields.\n",
    ">       - The object’s construction process is complex.\n",
    ">       - Multiple representations of the object are possible.\n",
    ">   - Directly assembling the parts of a complex object within a class can be inflexible and limit future changes.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Advantages**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - Allows you to vary a product’s internal representation.\n",
    ">   - Encapsulates code for construction and representation.\n",
    ">   - Provides control over the construction process steps.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Disadvantages**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - Requires creating a distinct ConcreteBuilder for each type of product.\n",
    ">   - Builder classes must be mutable.\n",
    ">   - May complicate dependency injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Structure**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - The Builder pattern involves the following components:\n",
    ">     - Director: Manages the construction process but doesn’t create the product directly.\n",
    ">     - Builder Interface: Defines methods for building parts of the complex object.\n",
    ">     - Concrete Builders: Implement the builder interface and create specific representations.\n",
    ">     - Product: Represents the final complex object."
