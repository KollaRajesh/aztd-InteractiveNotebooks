    ">  The **State Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. \n",
    ">    \n",
    ">   1. The pattern encapsulates the behavior of an object into different states and allows the object to transition from one state to another at runtime.  \n",
    ">   2. The purpose of the State pattern is to provide a systematic and loosely coupled way to change the behavior of an object based on its internal state.  \n",
    ">    \n",
    "> -  The *State pattern* addresses the following challenges:    \n",
    ">    1. It allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.   \n",
    ">    2. It avoids the use of conditional statements to change the behavior of an object.  \n",
    ">    3. It simplifies the code by dividing the behavior of an object into different states.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> - The *advantages* of the State pattern are:  \n",
    ">    1. It supports the principle of loose coupling between objects that interact with each other.   \n",
    ">    2. It allows for the separation of concerns.  \n",
    ">    3. It simplifies the code by dividing the behavior of an object into different states.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - The *disadvantages* of the State pattern are:\n",
    ">    1. The number of classes can increase significantly, which can make the code more complex.\n",
    ">    2. It can be difficult to decide when to use the State pattern.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - The *components* of the *State design pattern* are:\n",
    ">    1. *Context*: This is the object whose behavior changes based on its internal state.\n",
    ">    2. *State*: This is the interface that declares the methods that all concrete states should implement.\n",
    ">    3. *ConcreteState*: This is the class that implements the State interface and contains the behavior of the object for a particular state.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">  Here are two examples of the State design pattern in C#:"
