    "> -  The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities such as modules, classes, functions, etc., should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> -   The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -   The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.\n",
    ">       Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstraction."
