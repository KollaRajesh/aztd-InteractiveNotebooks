    "> The **Bridge Pattern** is a structural design pattern that aims to decouple an abstraction from its implementation.\n",
    ">   -  It allows you to separate the high-level abstraction (interface or abstract class) from the low-level implementation details.\n",
    ">   -  By doing so, the abstraction and implementation can vary independently, promoting flexibility and maintainability.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Purpose of the Bridge Pattern**\n",
    "> The Bridge Pattern addresses the following challenges:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   1. *Abstraction and Implementation Independence*:\n",
    ">     - When you want to create a system where the abstraction (interface or abstract class) and its implementation (concrete classes) can evolve independently.\n",
    ">     - When you need to avoid compile-time binding between the abstraction and its implementation.\n",
    ">   2. *Avoiding a Large Class Hierarchy*:\n",
    ">     - When using subclassing to implement different variations of an abstraction would lead to a large and complex class hierarchy.\n",
    ">     - The Bridge Pattern allows you to avoid this by separating the abstraction and implementation hierarchies.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Advantages of the Bridge Pattern**\n",
    ">   1. *Decoupling Abstraction and Implementation*:\n",
    ">     - It promotes loose coupling between the abstraction and its implementation.\n",
    ">     - Changes to one side do not affect the other side.\n",
    ">   2. *Flexibility and Extensibility*:\n",
    ">     - You can add new abstractions or implementations without modifying existing code.\n",
    ">     - It allows you to create new combinations of abstractions and implementations.\n",
    "> **Disadvantages of the Bridge Pattern**\n",
    ">   1. *Increased Complexity*:\n",
    ">     - Implementing the bridge can introduce additional complexity, especially when dealing with multiple abstractions and implementations.\n",
    ">   2. *Performance Overhead*:\n",
    ">     - The bridge may introduce additional method calls and indirection, impacting performance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Structure of the Bridge Pattern**\n",
    "> The Bridge Pattern consists of the following components:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   1. *Abstraction (Abstraction)*:\n",
    ">     - The high-level interface or abstract class that defines the abstraction.\n",
    ">     - Contains a reference to the implementation (Implementor).\n",
    ">     - Defines methods that delegate to the implementation.\n",
    ">   2. *Refined Abstraction (Concrete Abstraction)*:\n",
    ">     - Extends the abstraction by adding finer details.\n",
    ">     - Implements the high-level interface.\n",
    ">   3. *Implementor (Implementor)*:\n",
    ">     - The interface or abstract class that defines the implementation.\n",
    ">     - Contains methods that the abstraction delegates to.\n",
    ">   4. *Concrete Implementor (Concrete Implementor)*:\n",
    ">     - Provides the actual implementation of the methods defined in the Implementor.\n",
    ">     - Implements the low-level interface."
