    "> The **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.\n",
    ">  It provides a flexible way to extend the behavior of individual objects without altering their structure. Let’s dive into the details:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **What Is the Decorator Pattern**?\n",
    ">   - The decorator pattern allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure.\n",
    ">   - It achieves this by wrapping the original object with one or more decorator classes. \n",
    ">   - Each decorator class extends the behavior of the original object transparently by forwarding requests to it and performing additional functionality before or after forwarding the request.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Purpose of the Decorator Pattern**\n",
    "> The decorator pattern serves several purposes:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   1. *Responsibilities Extension*:\n",
    ">       - It allows responsibilities to be added to (and removed from) an object dynamically at runtime.\n",
    ">       - It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.\n",
    ">   2. *Open-Closed Principle*:\n",
    ">       - It adheres to the Open-Closed Principle by allowing functionality to be extended without modifying existing code.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Advantages of the Decorator Pattern**\n",
    ">   1. *Flexibility and Reusability*:\n",
    ">       - It allows dynamic extension of an object’s behavior.\n",
    ">       - Decorators can be combined in various ways to create different combinations of functionality.\n",
    ">   2. *Composition over Inheritance*:\n",
    ">       - It promotes composition over inheritance, avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Disadvantages of the Decorator Pattern**\n",
    ">   1. *Complexity*:\n",
    ">       - Implementing decorators can be complex, especially when multiple decorators are involved.\n",
    ">   2. *Performance Overhead*:\n",
    ">       - Decorators may introduce additional method calls and indirection, impacting performance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Structure of the Decorator Pattern**\n",
    "> The decorator pattern consists of the following components:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   1. *Component Interface*:\n",
    ">       - Defines the common interface for both the concrete component and decorators.\n",
    ">       - Represents the functionality that clients can access.\n",
    ">   2. *Concrete Component*:\n",
    ">       - The actual object that the client wants to decorate.\n",
    ">       - Implements the component interface.\n",
    ">   3. *Decorator*:\n",
    ">       - An abstract class or interface that wraps the concrete component.\n",
    ">       - Contains a reference to the component.\n",
    ">       - Implements the component interface.\n",
    ">       - May add additional behavior before or after forwarding requests to the component."
