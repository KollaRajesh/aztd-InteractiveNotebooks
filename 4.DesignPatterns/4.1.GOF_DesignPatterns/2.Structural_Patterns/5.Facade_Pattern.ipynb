    "> The Facade Pattern is a software design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming.\n",
    ">    -  It provides a simplified interface to a complex system by acting as a front-facing interface that masks more complex underlying or structural code.\n",
    ">    -   Much like a facade in architecture, the facade pattern simplifies interactions with a system by presenting a unified and simplified API.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **What Is the Facade Pattern**?\n",
    ">   The facade pattern serves several purposes:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   1. *Simplification and Readability*:\n",
    ">      - It improves the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single, often simplified, API.\n",
    ">      - It provides a context-specific interface to more generic functionality, complete with context-specific input validation.\n",
    ">   2. *Minimization of Dependencies*:\n",
    ">      - It minimizes dependencies on a subsystem by providing a unified interface.\n",
    ">      - Clients that directly access a complex subsystem often refer to many different objects with different interfaces (tight coupling), making clients hard to implement, change, test, and reuse.\n",
    ">  3. *Refactoring and Decoupling*:\n",
    ">     - It can serve as a launching point for refactoring monolithic or tightly-coupled systems into more loosely-coupled code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Developers commonly use the facade design pattern when a system is very complex, difficult to understand, or has many interdependent classes.\n",
    ">    - It hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client.\n",
    "> **Structure of the Facade Pattern**\n",
    "> The facade pattern consists of the following components:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   1. *Facade*:\n",
    ">      - The facade class is the central structuring unit of the pattern.\n",
    ">      - It implements a universal interface for the various interfaces of the subsystem.\n",
    ">      - It delegates important functionalities of the software to the respective sub-systems to simplify handling the various sub-components.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   2. *Subsystem Interfaces and Classes*:\n",
    ">      - These are the individual components of the system.\n",
    ">      - The facade delegates calls to these subsystem components.\n",
    ">      - The facade hides the implementation details of these subsystems from the client.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Advantages of the Facade Pattern**\n",
    ">   1. *Simplification and Readability*:\n",
    ">      - It simplifies complex systems by providing a unified interface.\n",
    ">      - It improves code readability and usability.\n",
    ">   2.  *Decoupling and Loose Coupling*:\n",
    ">      - It minimizes direct dependencies on subsystem components.\n",
    ">      - It promotes the principle of loose coupling.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Disadvantages of the Facade Pattern**\n",
    ">   1.  Complexity:\n",
    ">      - Implementing the facade class can be complex, especially for large systems.\n",
    ">   2. Performance Overhead:\n",
    ">      - The facade may introduce additional method calls and indirection, impacting performance."
