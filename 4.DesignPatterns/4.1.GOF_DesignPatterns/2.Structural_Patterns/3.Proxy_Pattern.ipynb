    ">   The **Proxy Pattern** is a structural design pattern that acts as a placeholder or surrogate for another object.  \n",
    ">    - It allows you to control access to the real object and provides additional functionality when accessing it.   \n",
    ">    - Proxies are used to manage access to expensive or sensitive resources, such as network connections, large objects in memory, or files.   \n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Components of the Proxy Pattern**  \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   1. *Subject (IObject)*:  \n",
    ">    -  The Subject interface defines the common interface between the real object and its proxy.  \n",
    ">    -  It declares methods that the proxy and real object must implement.  \n",
    ">    -  Represents the functionality that clients can access.  \n",
    ">   2. *Real Subject (Object)*:  \n",
    ">    - The Real Subject represents the actual object that the client wants to access.   \n",
    ">    - It implements the Subject interface.\n",
    ">    - Contains the real business logic.\n",
    ">   3. *Proxy*:\n",
    ">    - The Proxy class implements the Subject interface.\n",
    ">    - Acts as an intermediary between the client and the real subject.\n",
    ">    - Controls access to the real subject (e.g., by adding security checks, caching, or lazy initialization).\n",
    ">    - Can provide additional functionality before or after forwarding requests to the real subject.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Advantages of the Proxy Pattern**\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">   1. Controlled Access:\n",
    ">    - Proxies allow you to control access to the real object.\n",
    ">    - You can add security checks, logging, or other pre- or post-processing logic.\n",
    ">   2. Resource Management:\n",
    ">    - Proxies can manage expensive or limited resources (e.g., database connections, network sockets) by creating them lazily or releasing them when no longer needed.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Disadvantages of the Proxy Pattern**\n",
    ">   1. Complexity:\n",
    ">      - Introducing proxy classes can add complexity to the codebase.\n",
    ">      - Keeping proxies in sync with changes in the real subject can be challenging.\n",
    ">   2. Performance Overhead:\n",
    ">      - Proxies may introduce additional method calls and indirection, impacting performance."
