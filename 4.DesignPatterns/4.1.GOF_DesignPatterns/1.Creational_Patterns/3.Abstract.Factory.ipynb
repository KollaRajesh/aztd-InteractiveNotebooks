    ">  The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.   \n",
    "\n",
    ">  It allows the client code to create objects of different types that belong to the same family.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This pattern addresses several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Independence of Object Creation**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    - How can an application be independent of how its objects are created?\n",
    ">    - How can a class be independent of how the objects it requires are created?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Creating Related Objects**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    - How can families of related or dependent objects be created?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Advantages**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  - Flexibility: The pattern allows for interchangeable concrete implementations without changing the code that uses them, even at runtime.\n",
    ">  - Scalability: New derived types can be introduced without altering existing code that relies on the base class.\n",
    ">  - Modularity: It separates object creation from usage, promoting cleaner code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Disadvantages**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  - Complexity: Like other design patterns, excessive use can lead to unnecessary complexity.\n",
    ">  - Initial Overhead: Implementing factories and interfaces initially requires extra work.\n",
    ">  - Debugging Challenges: Higher abstraction levels can make systems harder to debug and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Structure**   \n",
    ">\n",
    "> The abstract factory pattern involves the following components:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  1. **Abstract Factory Interface**:\n",
    ">       - Declares methods for creating related product objects.\n",
    ">       - Concrete factories implement this interface.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">  2. **Concrete Factories**:\n",
    ">       - Implement the abstract factory interface.\n",
    ">       - Create specific families of related products.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">  3. **Abstract Product Interfaces**:\n",
    ">       - Declare methods for product objects.\n",
    ">       - Concrete products implement these interfaces.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">  4. **Concrete Products**:\n",
    ">       - Implement the abstract product interfaces.\n",
    ">       - Represent specific product variations.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  5. **Client**:\n",
    ">       - Uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Differences Between Factory Method and Abstract Factory*\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. *Factory Method*:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - Creates a single product type.\n",
    ">   - Subclasses define the product creation logic.\n",
    ">   - One factory per product type.\n",
    ">   - *Example*: Creating different types of pizzas.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  2. *Abstract Factory*:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - Creates families of related products.\n",
    ">   - Abstract factory defines the product creation logic.\n",
    ">   - One factory per product family.\n",
    ">   - *Example*: Creating GUI components (buttons, text boxes, etc.) for different operating systems."
