    ">   The **Singleton Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Let’s dive into the details:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "> **Problem:**\n",
    ">  - In software development, there are scenarios where you want to restrict the creation of multiple instances of a class.\n",
    ">  -  Common situations include managing shared resources (e.g., database connections, configuration settings) or ensuring consistent behavior across the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Purpose**:   \n",
    ">    **Restrict Instantiation**: The primary purpose of a singleton class is to limit the number of object creations to only one.   \n",
    ">    **Access Control**: It ensures controlled access to resources (e.g., database connections, configuration settings).   \n",
    ">    **Memory Efficiency**: Singleton prevents memory space wastage by restricting instance creation.  \n",
    "\n",
    " > **Solution (Singleton Design Pattern)**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">       The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has:\n",
    ">        1. One private constructor: Prevents external instantiation.\n",
    ">        2. One private static instance variable: Holds the single instance.\n",
    ">        3. One public static method (GetInstance()): Provides global access to the instance.\n",
    ">   Note The instance is created lazily (on-demand) or eagerly (at class loading time)."
