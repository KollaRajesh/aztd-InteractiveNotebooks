> 1. **let** and **const** Declaration:
  - In TypeScript, **let** and **const** are used for variable declarations.
  - let is used for variables whose values can be changed, while const is used for variables whose values cannot be changed after initialization.

```typescript
  let x: number = 10;
    x = 20; // OK

    const y: number = 10;
    y = 20; // Error: Cannot assign to 'y' because it is a constant.
```
> In this example, 
 - We define a variable x using let and assign it a value of 10.
 - We then change the value of x to 20, which is allowed. 
 - We define a variable y using const and assign it a value of 10.
 - We then try to change the value of y to 20, which is not allowed because y is a constant.

2. **Primitive types**: TypeScript has three very commonly used primitives: string, number, and boolean. Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript.

*Here are some examples*:

```typescript
let name: string = "Alice";
let age: number = 30;
let isStudent: boolean = true;
```
---
3. **Array**: To specify the type of an array like [1, 2, 3], you can use the syntax number[]; this syntax works for any type (e.g. string[] is an array of strings, and so on). You may also see this written as Array<number>, which means the same thing. 

*Here’s an example*:   

```typescript
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let numberList:Array<number>  = [1, 2, 3];
```
  The **map()** function is a built-in TypeScript function that is used to create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.  
   The syntax for using the **map()** function is as follows:  
   
```typescript
    array.map(callback [, thisObject])
```
*Here’s an example* of using the map() function in TypeScript: 
```typescript
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
const doubledNumbers: number[] = numbers.map((n: number) => n * 2);  
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  
```
In this example,  
 we define an array numbers with five elements.     
 - We then use the map() function to create a new array doubledNumbers with the results of multiplying each element of numbers by 2.    
 - We pass an arrow function (n: number) => n * 2 as the callback parameter to the map() function.    
 -  This function takes a number n as input and returns n * 2 as output.   Finally, we log the doubledNumbers array to the console.    

---

4. **Any**:
    - TypeScript also has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking error.

    - When a value is of type any, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal.     

 *Here’s an example*:

```typescript
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```

---

5. **Type annotations on variables**: 
  When you declare a variable using const, var, or let, you can optionally add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the variable:

```typescript
let myName: string = "Alice";
```

---
6. **Functions with parameters**: You can specify the types of function parameters using type annotations.
* Here’s an example:*
    ```typescript
    function greet(name: string) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    }

    greet("Alice");
    ```
---
7. **Return type annotations**: You can also specify the return type of a function using a return type annotation. Here’s an example:

```typescript
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

const result: number = add(1, 2);

```
---

8. **Functions returning promises**: You can specify the return type of a function that returns a promise using a generic type parameter.

 *Here’s an example*:

```typescript
function fetchUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
  // ...
}
```
To create a new promise, use the new keyword followed by Promise. The Promise constructor accepts a function which should take two parameters: A function to resolve the promise and a function to reject the promise. In TypeScript, add a type annotation to a Promise to indicate the type of value it resolves to. If not defined, it defaults to any.


>  *Promise&lt;T&gt; *: In TypeScript, a *Promise* is a special object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
     Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations and provide better control over the flow of code.

```typescript
     function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched successfully!");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((data: string) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error: Error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });

```
In this example,
  - We define a function fetchData that returns a Promise that resolves to a string after a delay of 2 seconds.
  - We then call the fetchData function and use the then method to log the resolved value to the console.
 - We also use the catch method to log any errors that occur during the asynchronous operation.
   
---
9. **Anonymous functions**: You can also specify the types of parameters and return values for *anonymous functions* using type annotations. Here’s an example:

```typescript
const greet = function (name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greet("Alice");

```
---
10. **Object types**: *Object types* are used to describe the shapes of JavaScript objects in TypeScript. They can specify the types, optionality, and readonlyness of properties. Here’s an example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address?: string;
  readonly id: number;
}

const alice: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30, id: 123 };

```
---
11. **Union Types**: A union type is a type that can represent values of multiple types. You can use the vertical bar (|) to separate each type. Here’s an example:

function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log(`ID is: ${id}`);
}

printId(101); // Output: ID is: 101
printId("202"); // Output: ID is: 202
---

12. **Type Aliases and Interfaces**:  Type aliases and interfaces are used to define custom types in TypeScript. They are similar in many ways, but there are some differences. Here’s an example of a type alias:.

```typescript
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

const point: Point = { x: 1, y: 2 };
```

```typescript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

const point: Point = { x: 1, y: 2 };

```

13. **Literal Types**:  Literal types are types that represent exact values. They can be used to create more precise types. Here’s an example:

```typescript
type Direction = "up" | "down" | "left" | "right";

function move(direction: Direction) {
  console.log(`Moving ${direction}...`);
}

move("up"); // Output: Moving up...
```


14. **Null and Undefined**: null and undefined are two distinct types in TypeScript that represent different values. undefined is used to indicate that a variable or property has not been initialized or does not have a value, while null is used to represent an intentional absence of a value. Here’s an example:

```typescript
let x: number | undefined;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

let y: number | null;
console.log(y); // Output: null

```

15. **Enums**:  An enum is a way to define a set of named constants in TypeScript. Enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. Here’s an example:

```typescript

    enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
    }

    const color: Color = Color.Red;
```
---
16. **keyof**: This operator is used to get a union type of all the property names of an object type.
    - It is useful when you want to create a new type based on the keys of an existing object type.
    
  *Here is an example*:

```typescript
  interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type PersonKeys = keyof Person; // "name" | "age"
```
---
17. **typeof: This operator is used to get the type of a value at runtime.
  - It is useful when you want to create a new type based on the type of a value.
  
  *Here is an example*:

```typescript
const x = 10;
type XType = typeof x; // number
```

18. **type** : *type* is a keyword in TypeScript that is used to define a new type alias.
 -  It allows you to create a new name for an existing type, or to create a union or intersection of types.
 - *Here are some examples:*

```typescript
type Age = number;

const age: Age = 25;

type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = Person & {
  id: number;
};

const employee: Employee = { name: "Alice", age: 25, id: 123 };

```
