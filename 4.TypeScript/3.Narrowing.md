>  1. **TypeScript Narrowing**:
 TypeScript narrowing is the process of refining types to more specific types than declared. TypeScript uses JavaScript constructs and control flow analysis to narrow down the types of variables and values in different branches of code. Here’s an example:

```typescript
 function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
  if (typeof padding === "number") {
    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
  }
  return padding + input;
}

```

In this example,
 - We define a function padLeft that takes two parameters: padding of type number | string and input of type string.
 - We use a type guard to check if padding is of type number, and if so, we use the repeat method to repeat a space character padding times and concatenate it with input.
 - If padding is of type string, we simply concatenate it with input.


> 2. **Type Guards**: 
  - A type guard is a special check that can refine types to more specific types than declared.
  - There are several ways to define and use type guards in TypeScript. Here’s an example:

```typescript 
  function isString(value: any): value is string {
  return typeof value === "string";
}

function printValue(value: any) {
  if (isString(value)) {
    console.log(`Value is a string: ${value}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Value is not a string: ${value}`);
  }
}

    printValue("hello"); // Output: Value is a string: hello
    printValue(42); // Output: Value is not a string: 42
```
>  In this example,
   - We define a function isString that takes a value of any type and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is a string.
   - We use the value is string syntax to tell TypeScript that the return value of isString is a type guard.
   - We then define a function printValue that takes a value of any type and uses the isString type guard to check if the value is a string. If it is, we log a message saying that the value is a string.
   - If it’s not, we log a message saying that the value is not a string.

> **Discriminated Unions**:
 - A *discriminated union* is a pattern in TypeScript that uses a common property with literal types to create a union type that can be narrowed down based on the value of that property. Here’s an example:

```typescript
interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  size: number;
}

interface Rectangle {
  kind: "rectangle";
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

function area(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "square":
      return shape.size ** 2;
    case "rectangle":
      return shape.width * shape.height;
  }
}

```

>  In this example,
  -  We define two interfaces Square and Rectangle that have a common property kind with literal types "square" and "rectangle", respectively.
  -  We then define a union type Shape that can be either a Square or a Rectangle. We define a function area that takes a Shape parameter and uses a switch statement to check the value of shape.kind.
  -  Depending on the value of shape.kind, we calculate the area of the shape and return it.

> **Exhaustiveness checking**:
  - *Exhaustiveness checking* is a technique in TypeScript that ensures that all possible cases of a union have been handled exhaustively.
  - We can use the never type to ensure that all possible cases of a union have been handled. Here’s an example:

```typescript
  interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle;

function area(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "square":
      return shape.size ** 2;
    case "rectangle":
      return shape.width * shape.height;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
```

> In this example,
  - We define an interface Circle that has a property kind with a literal type "circle".
  - We then add Circle to the Shape union type. We modify the area function to include a default case that assigns shape to a variable of type never.
  - This ensures that all possible cases of the Shape union have been handled exhaustively.
