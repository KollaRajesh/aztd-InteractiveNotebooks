> 1. **Object types**:   

  - Object types are used to describe the shapes of JavaScript objects in TypeScript.

  - They can specify the types, optionality, and readonlyness of properties.

> *Here’s an example*:

```typescript
 interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address?: string;
  readonly id: number;
}
```
> In this example,
  -  We define an interface Person that has four properties: name, age, address, and id. 
  - The name property is of type string, the age property is of type number, the address property is optional, and the id property is readonly.

---
> 2. **Index signatures**:

 - *Index signatures* are used to describe the types of possible values for properties whose names are not known ahead of time.  

 - They are also used to handle conflicts and excess properties.
 
 > *Here’s an example*:

```typescript
interface Dictionary<T> {
  [key: string]: T;
}

const dict: Dictionary<number> = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3
};
```

> In this example, 
  - we define an interface Dictionary that has an index signature.
  - The index signature specifies that any property name of type string can have a value of type T.
  - We then create an object dict that has three properties: a, b, and c, each with a value of type number.
----
> 3. **Extending types**:
  - Excess property checks are a type checking mechanism in TypeScript that validate objects more thoroughly when they are created and assigned to an object type during creation.
  -  When assigning an object literal to another type, TypeScript performs excess property checks to prevent typos or misspellings of property names. Here is an example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const person: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30, email: "alice@example.com" };

```
> In this example, 
 - We define an interface Person with two properties: name of type string and age of type number.
 -  We then create an object person with three properties: name, age, and email. Since email is not a property of Person, TypeScript reports an error.

> 4. **Extending types**:

  - *Extending types* is a way to create new types by copying or combining the members of existing types.  
 - Interfaces and intersection types are used to extend existing types.

> *Here are some examples*:

```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

type Cat = Animal & {
  color: string;
};

interface Pet {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  type: string;
}

type DogOrCat = Dog | Cat;

interface PetWithBreed extends Pet {
  breed: string;
}

type DogOrCatWithBreed = DogOrCat & PetWithBreed;
```

> In this example,
  - We define an interface Animal that has two properties: name and age.
  - We then define an interface Dog that extends Animal and adds a breed property. We also define a type Cat that combines Animal and an object with a color property.
  - We then define an interface Pet that has three properties: name, age, and type.
  - We define a type DogOrCat that can be either a Dog or a Cat.
  - Finally, we define an interface PetWithBreed that extends Pet and adds a breed property.
  - We also define a type DogOrCatWithBreed that is a DogOrCat with a PetWithBreed.

>  5. **Generic object types**:    

  - *Generic object types* are object types that can work with any sets of types.
    
  - They are used with arrays, tuples, and other data structures.
    
> *Here’s an example*:

```typescript
interface Pair<T, U> {
  first: T;
  second: U;
}

const pair1: Pair<number, string> = { first: 1, second: "hello" };
const pair2: Pair<string, boolean> = { first: "world", second: true };
```

> In this example,
 - We define an interface Pair that has two type parameters T and U.
 - The interface has two properties: first of type T and second of type U.
 - We then create two objects pair1 and pair2 that are instances of Pair.
 - pair1 has a first property of type number and a second property of type string.
 - pair2 has a first property of type string and a second property of type boolean.

> **Tuple types** :
  - Tuple types are used to represent fixed-length arrays with specific types at each position.
  - Tuple types can have optional and rest elements, and can be marked as readonly. Here is an example:

```typescript
type Point = [number, number];

const point: Point = [1, 2];

```
> In this example,
 - we define a tuple type Point with two elements of type number. We then create a tuple point with two elements: 1 and 2.
