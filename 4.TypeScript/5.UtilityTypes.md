1. **Record&lt;T,T&gt;** : This type is used to create a new object type with keys of type T and values of type T.

    - It is useful when you want to create an object with a set of keys and values of the same type. 
 
 *Here is an example*:

```typescript
 type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type PersonRecord = Record&lt;string, Person&gt; ;

const people: PersonRecord = {
  "person1": { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  "person2": { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  "person3": { name: "Charlie", age: 35 }
};
```
--- 
2. **Pick&lt;T,T&lt;**: This type is used to create a new object type by picking a subset of properties from an existing object type.
 
 *Here is an example*:

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address: string;
};

type PersonNameAndAge = Pick&lt;Person, "name" | "age"&gt; ;

const person: PersonNameAndAge = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
```
--- 
3. **Omit&lt;T,T&gt;** : This type is used to create a new object type by omitting a subset of properties from an existing object type.

*Here is an example*:

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address: string;
};

type PersonWithoutAddress = Omit&lt;Person, "address"&gt; ;

const person: PersonWithoutAddress = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
```
--- 
4. Exclude&lt;T,T&gt; : This type is used to create a new type by excluding all types from one type that are assignable to another type.

 *Here is an example*:

```typescript
 type A = string | number | boolean;
 type B = number | boolean; 
 type C = Exclude&lt;A, B&gt; ; // C is string
```
--- 
5. **Extract&lt;T,T&gt;** : This type is used to create a new type by extracting all types from one type that are assignable to another type.

 *Here is an example*:

```typescript
type A = string | number | boolean;
type B = number | boolean;
type C = Extract&lt;A, B&gt; ; // C is number | boolean
```
--- 
6. **Readonly&lt;T&gt;**: is a utility type in TypeScript that creates a new type with all properties of T set to readonly.

This means that the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned.

*Here is an example*:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

```
--- 

7. **Partial&lt;T&gt;** : This type is used to create a new object type with all properties of T set to optional.

 It is useful when you want to create an object with some optional properties.
 
 *Here is an example*:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type PartialPerson = Partial&lt;Person&gt; ;

const person: PartialPerson = { name: "Alice" };

```
--- 
8. **NonNullable&lt;T&gt;** : This type is used to create a new type by removing null and undefined from the given type.

 It ensures that the resulting type only contains non-null and non-undefined values. 
 *Here is an example*:

```typescript
type NullableString = string | null | undefined;
type NonNullableString = NonNullable&lt;NullableString&gt; ;

const str: NonNullableString = "Hello";
```
