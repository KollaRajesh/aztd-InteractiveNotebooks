> ### Class

> **Common Syntax of class**:

```typescript
class MyClass {
  // Fields
  private myField: string;
  public anotherField: number = 0;

  // Constructor
  constructor(myField: string) {
    this.myField = myField;
  }

  // Methods
  public myMethod(): void {
    console.log("Hello from myMethod!");
  }
}
```
In the above example, 
 - MyClass is the name of the class.
 -  It has two fields, *myField* and *anotherField*, and a *constructor* that takes a myField parameter. 
 - The *myMethod* method is also defined.

Here’s a breakdown of the syntax:

 - *class* keyword is used to define a class.
 - *MyClass* is the name of the class.
 - *myField* and *anotherField* are fields of the class.
 - *myField* is private, which means it can only be accessed within the class.
 -  *anotherField* is public, which means it can be accessed from outside the class.
 -  *constructor* is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created.
 -  It takes a *myField* parameter and assigns it to the *myField* field.
myMethod is a method of the class.
-  It is *public*, which means it can be accessed from outside the class.
-   It *logs* a message to the console.
 
 > 1.2 **Access Modifiers**:
   - Access modifiers are used to control the visibility of class members.
   - TypeScript provides three access modifiers: *public*, *private*, and *protected*.
    
      **public**: Members marked as public are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
      **private**: Members marked as private are only accessible from within the class.
      **protected**: Members marked as protected are accessible from within the class and its subclasses.

```typescript
      class MyClass {
      public publicField: string;
      private privateField: string;
      protected protectedField: string;

        constructor(publicField: string, privateField: string, protectedField: string) {
            this.publicField = publicField;
            this.privateField = privateField;
            this.protectedField = protectedField;
      }
    }
  const myObject = new MyClass("public", "private", "protected");
  console.log(myObject.publicField); // Output: public
  console.log(myObject.privateField); // Compile error
  console.log(myObject.protectedField); // Compile error
```
> 1.3 **readonly**:
   - *Read-only* properties are class properties that can only be assigned once, either in the constructor or at the declaration.
   - They prevent accidental or unwanted modifications of the property values after the class is instantiated.
   - To create a *read-only *property, you need to use the *readonly* modifier before the property name. 


  ```typescript
    class Person {
    readonly name: string; // read-only property
    constructor(name: string) {
      this.name = name; // can assign in the constructor
    }
  }
  const person = new Person("Alice");
  console.log(person.name); // Alice
  person.name = "Bob"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property
  ```

> 1.4 **Static** *methods* and **static** *properties* :
  In Typescript,
  - Static properties and methods are shared by all instances of a class.
  -  To declare a static property or method, you use the static keyword before the property or method name.

```typescript
 class MyClass {
  static myStaticProperty: string = "Hello, world!";

  static myStaticMethod(): void {
    console.log("Hello from myStaticMethod!");
  }
}

console.log(MyClass.myStaticProperty); // Output: Hello, world!
MyClass.myStaticMethod(); // Output: Hello from myStaticMethod!

```

> 2. **Generics in Class**
  -  In TypeScript, generics allow us to create classes that can work with a variety of types rather than a single one.
  
  - Here’s an example of a TypeScript class that uses generics:

```typescript
    class MyGenericClass<T> {
    private myArray: T[] = [];

    public add(item: T): void {
        this.myArray.push(item);
    }

    public get(index: number): T {
        return this.myArray[index];
    }
    }
 ```
  - In the above example, 
     - MyGenericClass is the name of the class.
     - It has one type parameter, T, which is used to define the type of the array.
     - The add method is used to add an item to the array, and the get method is used to retrieve an item from the array.

    Here’s a breakdown of the syntax:
    - class keyword is used to define a class.
    -  MyGenericClass is the name of the class.
        - <T> is the type parameter list in angle brackets that follows the name of the class. This allows us to use T as a type throughout the class.
        - myArray is a private field of the class that is an array of type T.
        - add method takes an argument of type T and adds it to the array.
        - get method takes an index and returns the item at that index in the array.

- How to use it 

```typescript
    const myStringArray = new MyGenericClass<string>();
    myStringArray.add("Hello");
    myStringArray.add("World");
    console.log(myStringArray.get(0)); // Output: Hello
    console.log(myStringArray.get(1)); // Output: World
```

3. **Parameter properties**:
 In TypeScript, parameter properties allow us to declare and initialize class members in a single place.
 
 -  Here’s an example of a TypeScript class that uses parameter properties:
```typescript
        class MyClass {
        constructor(private myField: string, public anotherField: number = 0) {}

        public myMethod(): void {
            console.log("Hello from myMethod!");
        }
        }

```

- In the above example,
  -  MyClass is the name of the class.
  -  It has two fields, myField and anotherField, which are declared and initialized in the constructor. The myMethod method is also defined.

- Here’s a breakdown of the syntax:
    - class keyword is used to define a class.
    - MyClass is the name of the class.
    - constructor is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created.
    -  It takes two parameters, myField and anotherField, which are used to declare and initialize the corresponding fields.
    - myMethod is a method of the class. It logs a message to the console.

- how to use the MyClass:

```typescript
const myObject = new MyClass("Hello, Rob!", 42);
console.log(myObject.myField); // Output: Hello, Rob!
console.log(myObject.anotherField); // Output: 42
myObject.myMethod(); // Output: Hello from myMethod!
```
----
4. **Abstract Class**:
    In TypeScript, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.  
     - It is meant to be inherited by other classes that can be instantiated.   
     - Abstract classes can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods and properties. 
     - Abstract methods are methods that do not have an implementation in the abstract class and must be implemented in the derived class.
     
     -  Here’s an example of an abstract class in TypeScript:
```Typescript
     abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void;

  move(): void {
    console.log("Moving...");
  }
}
```
- In the above example, 
  *Animal* is an abstract class that has one *abstract* method *makeSound* and one *non-abstract* method *move*.

- Here’s an example of how to use the Animal class:

```typescript
class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Bark!");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.makeSound(); // Output: Bark!
dog.move(); // Output: Moving...
```

- In the above example, 
    - We create a *Dog* class that extends the *Animal* class.
    - We implement the makeSound method in the *Dog* class and instantiate a *Dog* object.
    - We then call the makeSound and move methods on the *Dog* object.

*Abstract class* **vs** *interface*
 - In TypeScript, both *abstract* classes and *interfaces* are used to define the structure of objects. However, they serve slightly different purposes.

 - An *abstract* class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.
 - It is meant to be inherited by other classes that can be instantiated.
 - Abstract classes can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods and properties.
 - Abstract methods are methods that do not have an implementation in the abstract class and must be implemented in the derived class.

- Here’s an example of an *abstract*:

```typescript
  abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void;

  move(): void {
    console.log("Moving...");
  }
}
```
  On the other hand, an *interface* is a contract that defines the structure of an object.
  -  It contains only method signatures and property names with their types.
  -  Interfaces cannot contain any implementation code.


 - Here’s an example of an *interface*:
```typescript
interface IAnimal {
  makeSound(): void;
  numberOfLegs: number;
}

```
----
5. *extends* **vs** *implements*:

TypeScript class that uses both extends and implements:

```typescript
interface IMyInterface {
  doSomething(): void;
}

class MyBaseClass {
  private myBaseField: string;

  constructor(myBaseField: string) {
    this.myBaseField = myBaseField;
  }

  public myBaseMethod(): void {
    console.log(`myBaseField: ${this.myBaseField}`);
  }
}

class MyClass extends MyBaseClass implements IMyInterface {
  private myField: number;

  constructor(myBaseField: string, myField: number) {
    super(myBaseField);
    this.myField = myField;
  }

  public doSomething(): void {
    console.log(`Hello from doSomething! myField: ${this.myField}`);
  }
}

const myObject = new MyClass("Hello, world!", 42);
myObject.myBaseMethod(); // Output: myBaseField: Hello, world!
myObject.doSomething(); // Output: Hello from doSomething! myField: 42
```

In the above example, 
  - IMyInterface is the name of the interface. It has one method, doSomething.
  - MyBaseClass is the name of the base class. It has one field, myBaseField, and one method, myBaseMethod. 
  - MyClass is the name of the derived class. It has one field, myField, and implements IMyInterface.
  - MyClass extends MyBaseClass, which means that it inherits the myBaseField and myBaseMethod members.

- To create an instance of the MyClass, we use the *new* keyword followed by the class name and the myBaseField and myField parameters. We then call the myBaseMethod and doSomething methods on the MyClass object.

---
6. **private** *vs* **#private**
 In TypeScript,
   -  private keyword is used to mark a member private which makes it inaccessible outside the declared class. However, compile time checking can be easily bypassed, for example by casting away the type information. 
   - The private keyword is also not enforced at runtime.

   -  On the other hand, #private fields ensure that properties are kept private at runtime. Private fields are preceded by #.
   -  Private fields originates from a TC-39 ECMAScript proposal and are part of the 2021 ECMAScript specification, which means that they can be used in both normal JavaScript and TypeScript.

```typescript
class MyClass {
  private myField: string;
  #anotherField: number = 0;

  constructor(myField: string) {
    this.myField = myField;
  }

  public myMethod(): void {
    console.log(`myField: ${this.myField}`);
    console.log(`#anotherField: ${this.#anotherField}`);
  }
}

const myObject = new MyClass("Hello, world!");
myObject.myMethod();
```
---
7. **this** in class:
    - In TypeScript, this keyword refers to the current instance of the class.
    -  It is used to access the members of the class. 

```typescript
Here’s an example of how to use this:

class MyClass {
  private myField: string;

  constructor(myField: string) {
    this.myField = myField;
  }

  public myMethod(): void {
    console.log(`myField: ${this.myField}`);
  }
}

const myObject = new MyClass("Hello, Mark!");
myObject.myMethod();

```

---

8. **Decorators** and **Attributes**:
 In TypeScript,
   - Decorators are a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.
   - They are functions that can be used to modify the behavior of a class or its members. 
   
Here’s an example of a TypeScript class that uses decorators:

```typescript
function log(target: any, key: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  console.log(`Called ${key}()`);
}

class MyClass {
  @log
  public myMethod(): void {
    console.log("Hello from myMethod!");
  }
}

```
- In the above example,
  - *MyClass* is the name of the class. It has one method, *myMethod*, which is decorated with the *@log* decorator.
  - The *log* function is called every time *myMethod* is invoked.

- Here’s a breakdown of the syntax:

    - function keyword is used to define a function.
    - *log* is the name of the function.
    - *target*, *key*, and *descriptor* are parameters of the function. They are used to get information about the class and its members.
    - *@log* is the decorator that is applied to the *myMethod* method.
    - *MyClass* is the name of the class.
    - *myMethod* is a method of the class. It *logs* a message to the console.

- Here’s an example of how to use the MyClass:

```typescript
const myObject = new MyClass();
myObject.myMethod(); // Output: Called myMethod() \n Hello from myMethod!
```
- In the above example, 
    - we create an instance of MyClass and call the myMethod method.
    - The log function is called every time myMethod is invoked.

In TypeScript, **attributes** are properties that can be added to a class or its members.   
They can be used to add metadata to a class or its members.

Here’s an example of a TypeScript class that uses attributes:
```typescript
function customAttribute(target: any, key: string) {
    console.log(`Custom attribute called on ${key}`);
}


class MyClass {
   @customAttribute
    public myField: string;

  constructor(myField: string) {
    this.myField = myField;
  }
}

const myObject = new MyClass("old value");
myObject.myField = "New value";

```
- The customAttribute function is called every time myField is accessed.
