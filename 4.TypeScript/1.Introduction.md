> ### TypeScript :
 - *TypeScript* is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript.
 - *TypeScript* is designed to help developers write more robust and maintainable code by catching errors at compile-time rather than run-time.
 - *TypeScript* is also compatible with existing JavaScript code, which makes it easy to adopt in existing projects.

> **Benefits of using typescript** :

TypeScript offers a plethora of benefits for web and mobile app developers.

Here are some benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript:

1. **Type safety**: TypeScript adds a type system to JavaScript, which helps catch errors at compile-time rather than run-time. This makes it easier to write and maintain large codebases.  

2. **Tooling**: TypeScript integrates well with modern development tools like Visual Studio Code, which provides features like code completion, refactoring, and navigation.  

3. **Scalability**: TypeScript is designed to scale from small scripts to large applications. It supports features like modules, namespaces, and interfaces that help organize code and make it more reusable.  

4. **Readability**: TypeScript’s type annotations make code more self-documenting and easier to understand. They also help catch errors early in the development process.

5. **Compatibility**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This makes it easy to adopt TypeScript in existing projects.

6. **Community**: TypeScript has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support to others.

> Here’s an example of how TypeScript can improve code quality and readability:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function greet(person: Person) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${person.name}! You are ${person.age} years old.`);
}

const alice = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
greet(alice);

```

> In this example,
 - We define an interface Person that has two properties: name and age.  
 - We then define a function greet that takes a Person object as a parameter and logs a greeting to the console.  
 - Finally, we create an object alice that has a name property of type string and an age property of type number, and pass it to the greet function.  
 - TypeScript’s type system ensures that the greet function is called with a valid Person object, and that the name and age properties are accessed correctly.  

> To install TypeScript, you can use the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

```sh
npm install -g typescript
```

```typescript
class Student {
    fullName: string;
    constructor(public firstName: string, public middleInitial: string, public lastName: string) {
        this.fullName = firstName + " " + middleInitial + " " + lastName;
    }
}

interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}

function greeter(person: Person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}

let user = new Student("Jane", "M.", "User");

document.body.textContent = greeter(user);
```

> Compiling your code

  - Run tsc *greeter.ts *and you’ll see the generated JavaScript (*greeter.js*).
  - Classes in TypeScript are just a shorthand for the same prototype-based OO that is frequently used in JavaScript.

```sh
tsc --noEmitOnError  greeter.ts
```

> Running your TypeScript web app

  - Now type the following in greeter.html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>TypeScript Greeter</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="greeter.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```

> **Static type-checking**:
 - It is a type-checking process that is performed at compile-time.
 - TypeScript adds a type system to JavaScript, which helps catch errors at compile-time rather than run-time.
 - This makes it easier to write and maintain large codebases. Here’s an example of how TypeScript can help catch errors at compile-time:

```typescript
function add(x: number, y: number) {
  return x + y;
}

  add(1, 2); // returns 3
  add("1", "2"); // Error: Argument of type '"1"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

> In this example, 
  - We define a function add that takes two parameters of type number and returns their sum.
  - When we call the function with two numbers, it returns the expected result.
  - However, when we call the function with two strings, TypeScript catches the error and reports it at compile-time.

---
> **Non-exception Failures**:
   These are cases where the JavaScript runtime throws its hands up and tells us that it thinks something is nonsensical.
   Those cases come up because the ECMAScript specification has explicit instructions on how the language should behave when it runs into something unexpected.
  
>  Here’s an example of non-exception failures:

```typescript
  let x: number = NaN;
  let y: number = 5;

  x + y; // returns NaN
```
> In this example,
  - We define two variables x and y.
  - x is assigned the value NaN, which stands for “Not a Number”.
  - When we add x and y, the result is NaN.
  -  This is a non-exception failure because the ECMAScript specification defines that any arithmetic operation involving NaN should return NaN.

---
> Erased Types: 
  - Type erasure is the process of removing type annotations from TypeScript code as it is transpiled to JavaScript.
  - The types you use in TypeScript can’t be inspected at run-time, when JavaScript is being executed. 
  
>   *Here’s an example of type erasure*:

```typescript
let name: string = 'John';
let name: string;
```

> In this example,
- We define a variable name and assign it a value of 'John'.
- When this code is transpiled to JavaScript, the type annotation : string is removed, and the resulting code is equivalent to let name;.

---

**Explicit Types**: 
  - Explicit typing means adding a type directly to our codebase.
  - If we add such a type, we will know exactly what type we are using. Here’s an example of explicit typing:

```typescript
const animal: string = 'Tiger';
```
>  In this example, we define a constant animal and explicitly specify its type as string.
---

> **Downleveling**:

    *Downleveling* is the process of transpiling newer JavaScript features to older versions for compatibility.
    
>  *Here’s an example of downleveling*:

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
```
> In this example,
  - We use an arrow function to double each number in an array.
  - When this code is transpiled to JavaScript, the arrow function is replaced with a regular function for compatibility with older browsers:
  
```javascript
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
var doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (n) { return n * 2; });

```
