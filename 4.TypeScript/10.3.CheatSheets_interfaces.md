> **Common Syntax of interface** : Interfaces in TypeScript are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.
  
  
  1. They are used to describe the shape of an object, and can include properties, methods, and index signatures.

```typescript
 interface Employee {
  name: string;
  getName(): string;
  [key: string]: any;
}
/*This interface has a property called name of type string, a method called getName that returns string, and an index signature that allows for additional properties of any type.*/
```
  2. Interfaces can also include optional properties, which are denoted by a ? after the property name.

```typescript
interface Person {
  OptionalName?: string;
}
```
 3. Interfaces can extend other interfaces using the extends keyword:

```typescript
 interface Employee extends Person {
  myProperty: string;
}
```
 4. Interfaces can also be used to describe function types:

```typescript
 interface IsBonusReceived {
  (empNumber: number, FirstName: string): boolean;
}
```

> **Generics**: Declare a type which can change in interface

```typescript 
interface Stack<T> {
    push(item: T): void;
    pop(): T | undefined;
    peek(): T | undefined;
    isEmpty(): boolean;
    size(): number;
}
```
---
> **Overloads**: A callable interface can have multiple definitions for different sets of parameters

```typescript
interface Stack<T> {
    push(item: T): void;
    push(items: T[]): void;
    push(itemOrItems: T | T[]): void 
}

```
--- 
> **Get & Sets**: object can have custom getters or setters 



```typescript 
interface Person {
    name: string;
    get age():number;
    set age(value:number| string);
}
//usage 
const person:Person;
person.age=12;
person.age="24";
 
```
---
> **Extension via merging**:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}
interface Address {
  AddressLine1: string;
  City: string;
  State: string;
}

interface Employee extends Person,Address {
  empCode: number;
}
/*In this example, we have two interfaces Person and Address, and we want to merge them into a new interface Employee. The extends keyword is used to indicate that Employee should inherit the properties of both Person and Address.
 We can then add additional properties to Employee as needed.*/

interface Manager extends Employee {
  isManageTeam: boolean;
}

type Director = Manager & Employee;

/*In this example, we have two interfaces Manager and Employee, and we want to merge them into a new type Director. 

The & operator is used to indicate that Director should include all properties from both Manager and Employee.*/

```
---
> **Class Conformance**: ensure a class conforms to an interface via implement

```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

class Employee implements Person {
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number, public salary: number) {}

    getSalary(): number {
        return this.salary;
    }

    setSalary(salary: number): void {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
//Another example
interface Stack<T> {
    push(item: T): void;
    push(items: T[]): void;
    push(itemOrItems: T | T[]): void 
    pop(): T | undefined;
    peek(): T | undefined;
    isEmpty(): boolean;
    size(): number;
}

class ArrayStack<T> implements Stack<T> {
    private items: T[] = [];

    push(item: T): void;
    push(items: T[]): void;
    push(itemOrItems: T | T[]): void {
        if (Array.isArray(itemOrItems)) {
            this.items.push(...itemOrItems);
        } else {
            this.items.push(itemOrItems);
        }
    }

    pop(): T | undefined {
        return this.items.pop();
    }

    peek(): T | undefined {
        return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
    }

    isEmpty(): boolean {
        return this.items.length === 0;
    }

    size(): number {
        return this.items.length;
    }
}
```
