    ">  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects .\n",
    ">   There are four basic principles of OOP.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  1. Encapsulation\n",
    ">  2. Abstraction\n",

    "\n",
    "> 1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the practice of keeping the internal workings of an object hidden from the outside world.     \n",
    ">     This is achieved by defining a public interface for the object, which allows other objects to interact with it, while keeping the details of its implementation hidden.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of identifying the essential characteristics of an object, and ignoring everything else.    \n",
    ">     This allows us to create models of complex systems that are easier to understand and work with     \n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is the process of creating new classes from existing ones.   \n",
    ">     This allows us to reuse code that has already been written, and to create new classes that are similar to existing ones, but with some modifications.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on many forms.   \n",
    ">     This allows us to write code that can work with objects of different types, without having to know the details of those types   "
